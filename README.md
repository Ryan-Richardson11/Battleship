Battleship Game in Java and Python
This repository contains the implementation of the classic Battleship game in both Java and Python. The game allows players to take turns guessing the locations of hidden ships on a grid. The project consists of two main files: BattleshipJAVA.java and battleship_python.py.

BattleshipJAVA.java

This Java implementation of Battleship follows a simple console-based interface. The game initializes a grid, places ships randomly, and prompts the user to input guesses until all ships are sunk.

Gameplay:

The program will prompt you to enter a row and column for your guess.
Rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 9.
The game will display the grid with hits, misses, and remaining ships.
Continue guessing until all ships are sunk.

battleship_python.py

This Python implementation of Battleship mirrors the functionality of the Java version. It provides a console-based interface and allows users to play the game by entering row and column coordinates.

Gameplay:

The program will prompt you to enter a row and column for your guess.
Rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 9.
The game will display the grid with hits, misses, and remaining ships.
Continue guessing until all ships are sunk.
Unit Tests:

The repository includes unit test files to verify the functionality of the game.
- test_HitOrMiss.py
- test_isGameOver.py
- test_setupBoard.py
